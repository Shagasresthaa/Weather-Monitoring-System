# Weather-Monitoring-System
A simple weather monitoring system using arduino, raspberry pi,Mobile application and a Python Flask based REST API

Mobile Login Authentication system uses Firebase.

Working on an SMD version of the node. Components for this will be marked with "*".

ATMEGA2560 16 AU will be used for this version due to more SRAM and program memory bypassing the memory restrictions due to an Arduino Nano running ATMEGA328P AU.

The bootloader burner to be used for this is also included in project including schematics, gerber files.

Arduino bootloader will be used for this ATMEGA2560.

This is a simple weather monitoring project for monitoring temperature, preasure and humidity using arduino nano nodes and a raspbery pi to upload the data to a custom REST API from which data can be retreived to a mobile application for remote monitoring

## Arduino Libraries Used

Will be modifying list to accommodate all new hardware changes

## Components Used

Going to add a fresh list of components used in order to accommodate all new changes in hardware 

Components marked with * are to be used in the SMD Edition of the monitoring node.

The Weather Node V4 and its SMD version will be used for the project

## If anyone finds any issue or anything that can be done better in schematic or PCB design or anything else in this project do raise an issue

## More to be added as project progresses
