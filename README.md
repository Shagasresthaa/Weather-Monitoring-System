This is a simple weather monitoring project for monitoring temperature, preasure and humidity using arduino nano nodes and a raspbery pi to upload the data to a online database later retreived to a mobile application for remote monitoring

## Arduino Libraries Used

1. Adafruit GFX library
2. Adafruit SSD1306
3. Adafruit ESP8266
4. AdaFruit BMP085
5. Simple DHT11
6. Software Serial
7. Wire.h

## Components Used

1. Arduino Nano V3
2. Arduino Uno R3 (For receiving data from nodes)
3. Raspbery Pi 4 Model B (4GB) (Any raspbery pi can be used. I used 4 gb version in view of other personal uses)
4. 0.91 inch oled display (Used SSD1306 driver)
5. MicroSD Card Module (For backup data logging and logging node error events)
6. BMP180 sensor (Uses Adafruit BMP085 library)
7. DHT11 sensor (Uses Simple DHT Library)
8. 3 resistors (1k,2/2.2k,10k for ESP8266)
9. A 3S Lipo Battery

## More to be added as project progresses
